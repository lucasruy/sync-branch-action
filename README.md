## Sync Branch Action
[![CI](https://github.com/LucasRuy/sync-branch-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LucasRuy/sync-branch-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
![PR](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-blue)

An action to automate your branch update process. This action opens a pull request automatically for you whenever there are changes in a branch that you want to observe.

## Features
 - Open a pull request whenever there are changes to a branch you want to observe.
 - Before opening a new pull request, check if there is already an open one with the same purpose. If so, a new pull request is not opened.
 - If a pull request is already open and there are changes to the observed branch, those changes are automatically included in the pull request already open.
 - If `label` is provided and doesn't exist in the repository, action creates missing label.
